UFL - Unified Form Language
===========================

The Unified Form Language (UFL) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational
forms. More precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing
finite element spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a
notation close to mathematical notation.

Documentation
=============

The UFL documentation is hosted at http://fenics-ufl.rtfd.org/.


Installation
============

Linux::

  sudo python setup.py install


Directories
===========

- ufl/

  All source code for the UFL implementation.

- scripts/

  Commandline utilities like "ufl-analyse", "ufl-convert" and "form2ufl".

- demo/

  Several ufl form files which demonstrates the use of the form language.

- doc/

  The UFL documentation resides here. See doc/sphinx/README for how to
  generate the docucmentation.

- test/

  Unit tests for the UFL implementation. Run all tests by typing
  "python test.py" inside the test/ directory.


Utilities
=========

For more information about the utilities, type::

  ufl-analyse -h
  ufl-convert -h
  form2ufl -h

after installation.


About the Python modules
========================

The global namespace of the module ufl contains the entire UFL
language::

  from ufl import *

Form compilers may want to import additional implementation details
like::

  from ufl.classes import *

and::

  from ufl.algorithms import *

Importing a .ufl file can be done easily from Python::

  from ufl.algorithms import load_ufl_file
  filedata = load_ufl_file("filename.ufl")
  forms = filedata.forms
  elements = filedata.elements

to get lists of forms and elements from the .ufl file, or::

  from ufl.algorithms import load_forms
  forms = load_forms("filename.ufl")

to get a list of forms in the .ufl file.
