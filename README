  sudo python setup.py install


Directories
-----------

- ufl/
  All source code for the UFL implementation.

- scripts/
  Commandline utilities like "ufl-analyse", "ufl-convert" and "form2ufl".

- demo/
  Several ufl form files which demonstrates the use of the form language.

- doc/
  The UFL manual resides here.

- test/
  Unit tests for the UFL implementation. Run all tests by typing "python test.py" inside the test/ directory.

- sandbox/
  A place for experimental scripts and other unofficial code.


Utilities
---------

For more information about the utilities, type
  ufl-analyse -h
  ufl-convert -h
  form2ufl -h
after installation.


About the Python modules
------------------------

The global namespace of the module ufl contains the entire UFL language:
  from ufl import *

Form compilers may want to import additional implementation details like
  from ufl.classes import *
and
  from ufl.algorithms import *

Importing a .ufl file can be done easily from Python:
  from ufl.algorithms import load_ufl_file
  filedata = load_ufl_file("filename.ufl")
  forms = filedata.forms
  elements = filedata.elements
to get lists of forms and elements from the .ufl file, or
  from ufl.algorithms import load_forms
  forms = load_forms("filename.ufl")
to get a list of forms in the .ufl file.
