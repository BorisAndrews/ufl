This directory contains unofficial scripts,
snippets, test codes, and whatnot.
Main structure of this directory:

  operatortests/    - test snippets for operators (these should usually become unit tests)
  algorithmtests/   - test snippets for algorithms
  scripts/          - utility scripts that perform some minor task
  suggestions/      - for .ufl files with new suggested syntax
  profiling/        - scripts doing something to be profiled
  pylintlog/        - pylint script for doing static code analysis on ufl

Please try to keep it tidy by at least
making a personal folder for messy stuff.
