Roadmap for the development of UFL
----------------------------------

- Elaborate more on the feature list on the wiki, trying to exhaust all ideas we have

- Define syntactic tests

- Discuss implementation approach (base on sympy? depends on the complexity we want)

- Finish implementation of UFL prototype such that all the syntactic tests pass

- Define tests that require a form compiler and verifies the computed element tensors
  (can use ufc_benchmark module and compare with results from existing working form compiler implementations)

- Implement utility algorithms that aid in the implementation of form compilers

- Implement UFL support in form compilers

- Make all tests pass for all form compiler configurations!
