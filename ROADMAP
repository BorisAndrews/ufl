Roadmap for the development of UFL
----------------------------------

Some of the TODO's left:

# Tensor handling:
 - Do we need UFLObject.repeated_indices()?
 - Do we need UFLObject.free_index_dimensions()?
 - Test and finalize class Tensor.

# Derivatives:
 - Finish Diff design, including index handling like in PartialDiff and Product.
 - Apply Variable in automatic differentiation to define subexpressions we can reuse.

# Algorithms:
 - Implement contraction function that expands all implicit summations into Sums
 - Implement evaluation function for swiginac and sympy, given expressions for each basisfunction and function.
 - Several small details and much testing remains in existing algorithms

# Elements and Basisfunctions (only minor or rare issues left):
 - Implement 'Test/Trial/BasisFunctions' for general tensor subelement with arbitrary symmetries
 - Add Cell support?
 - Keep or drop name from Function? Can eventually pass it to UFC if we add a "form::coefficient_name(i)" function.
 - Degree range for quadrature elements?
 - Agree on final design!

# Time derivatives (can wait):
 - Do we want something like Dt(u), Dtt(u), CR(a), FE(a), BE(a), TR(a, theta)? 

# Prettyness and readability (can wait):
 - Improve parentesis use in __str__ and __repr__ and ufl2latex, use precedence list

# Tests:
 - Implement more elaborate tests, some operators aren't tested, and only a few of the algorithms.

# Documentation:
 - Write the manual (can perhaps reuse some text I have)
 - Write the paper/book chapter (can perhaps reuse some text I have)
 - Improve operator docstrings
 - Rewrite/improve all error messages

# License:
 - Which license do we pick? GPL3 or LGPL3?
