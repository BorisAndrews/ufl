Roadmap for the development of UFL
----------------------------------

Some of the TODO's left:

# Elements and Basisfunctions:
 - Agree on final design!
 - Add Cell support?
 - Keep or drop name from Function? Can eventually pass it to UFC if we add a "form::coefficient_name(i)" function.
 - Do we need 'Test/Trial/BasisFunctions'? If so, fix count issue.

# Algorithms:
 - Implement contraction function that expands all implicit summations into Sums
 - Implement evaluation function for swiginac and sympy, given expressions for each basisfunction and function.

# Derivatives:
 - Decide on Symbol / Variable design. Drop Symbol and make Variable a Terminal?
 - Finish Diff design, including index handling like in PartialDiff. and Product.
 - Implement something like UFLObject._shallow_diff(self, variable)
 - Implement automatic differentiation using Variable to extract subexpressions.

# Prettyness and readability:
 - Improve parentesis use in __str__ and __repr__ and ufl2latex, use precedence list

# Tests:
 - Implement more elaborate tests, some operators aren't tested, and only a few of the algorithms.

# Documentation:
 - Write the manual (can perhaps reuse some text I have)
 - Write the paper/book chapter (can perhaps reuse some text I have)
 - Improve operator docstrings
 - Rewrite/improve all error messages

# License:
 - Which license do we pick? GPL3 or LGPL3?
