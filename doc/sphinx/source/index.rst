Unified Form Language (UFL) documentation
=========================================

This is the documentation for the Unified Form Language from the
FEniCS Project (http://fenicsproject.org).


The Unified Form Language (UFL) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational
forms. More precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing
finite element spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a
notation close to mathematical notation. UFL is described in the paper

Alnæs, M. S., Logg A., Ølgaard, K. B., Rognes, M. E. and
Wells, G. N. (2014). Unified Form Language: A domain-specific language
for weak formulations of partial differential equations. ACM
Transactions on Mathematical Software 40(2), Article 9, 37
pages. [http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1145/2566630>]
