====================
Sphinx documentation
====================

UFL is documented using Sphinx and reStructured text. The
documentation is hosted at http://fenics-ufl.readthedocs.org/. The
online documentation is automatically updated upon pushes to the UFL
master branch.


Updating the API documentation
==============================

If the UFL API is changed, the script::

    ./generate-apidoc

must be run to update the autodoc file. The script can be run from any
directory.


Building the documentation locally
==================================

The HTML documentation can be built locally using::

    make html

In order for changes in the docstring to be propagated to the html pages,
ufl must be installed anew.
In other words, sphinx reads the docstrings from the installed code,
not the source code.
